# 🎄 Spirit of Christmas Program 🎄

A festive Java program that embodies the spirit of Christmas through symbolic gestures of kindness, joy, and unity. This
program begins with a cheerful ASCII art canvas of a Christmas tree and gifts, followed by a simulated distribution of
symbolic gifts to reflect the season's essence.
